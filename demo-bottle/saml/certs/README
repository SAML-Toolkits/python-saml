Take care of this folder that could contain private key. Be sure that this folder never is published.

Onelogin Python Toolkit expects that certs for the SP could be stored in this folder as:

 * sp.key   Private Key
 * sp.cert  Public cert

Also you can use other cert to sign the metadata of the SP using the:

 * metadata.key
 * metadata.cert
